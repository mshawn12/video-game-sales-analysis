## Background Information
The team will leverage a Global Video Game Sales & Ratings dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-video-game-sales-ratings) in order to test various hypotheses about video game genres.


## Process
- Step 1: Creating Jupyter Notebook to load, clean, and export Excel files as CSVs
- Step 2: Creating an ERD Diagram

## Requirements
For Project 3, you will work with your group to tell a story using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:
- Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
- Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:
    - A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
    - A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
    - A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
- Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
- Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
- Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
- Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
